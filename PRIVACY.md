# AI & Data Security Policy | Circular Culture

**"Transparent Technology, Secure Transformation"**

At Circular Culture, we prioritize data privacy and ethical AI in every circular economy analysis we perform.

## 1. Open Source Transparency
Our core AI logic is open-source and hosted on GitHub. This allows our clients and the community to audit how data is processed and ensure no hidden biases or data-leaking mechanisms exist.

## 2. Zero Retention Policy
Data shared with our AI Consultant for real-time analysis is not used for training models or stored for third-party access. Once the session is concluded, the operational data is discarded.

## 3. Anonymized Processing
Before processing, sensitive identifiers (company names, specific locations, trade secrets) are removed. The AI only analyzes technical "waste and resource" metrics.

## 4. Secure Infrastructure
All data processing occurs within Vercel’s secure Global Edge Network, protected by industry-standard encryption (AES-256).

## 5. Human-in-the-Loop
No AI-generated report is considered final. Every strategy is reviewed and validated by our expert consultants before being presented as a professional recommendation.
